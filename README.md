## About The Project

![v-FIT Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=v-FIT+Virtual+Fitting+Room)

The fashion e-commerce industry suffers from a critical flaw: customers cannot try on clothes. This leads to return rates as high as 40%, costing retailers billions and creating a frustrating experience for shoppers.

**v-FIT** is a project dedicated to solving this problem by leveraging modern technology to create a true-to-life fitting experience. Our core mission is to build a platform where users can generate a personalized 3D "Digital Twin" of themselves and use it to see exactly how clothes will fit and look before they buy.

This repository contains the source code for the foundational web platform, which serves as the core engine for avatar creation and the primary virtual try-on experience.
